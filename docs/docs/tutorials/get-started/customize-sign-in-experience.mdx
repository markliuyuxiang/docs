# Customize sign-in experience

In the "Get Started" tab, click the "Customize" button on the right, and the browser will redirect to the Sign-in Experience tab.

## Sign-in preview

:::tip Do you know...
You can preview the result in real-time! No matter what you update on the left, the right-side UI will immediately update to synchronize the change.
:::

The customer may use the app under different conditions, including platform, language, and appearance.

Feel free to change them to see the result of your combination.

## Branding

In this area, you can define several main elements of brand exposé: color, logo, and slogan.

- **Brand color** will affect the primary color of components, e.g., buttons and links.
- **Enable dark mode** controls if the UI has a "dark feeling" when Logto detects related system preference.
- Other options are pretty straightforward, so we skip them here.

## Others

Let's skip "Sign-in methods" for now and move to the "Others" tab.

### Terms of use

An app will likely have a Terms of Use in production, and it's mandatory to accept it before signing in or creating an account.

Toggle on "Enable terms of use" and enter the URL to enforce this process. Logto will load it via an `<iframe>`.

### Language

Logto provides six predefined languages (v1.0.0-beta.11). You can customize values of invidual keys.

In addition, it provides 113 language tags. You can create an added language , bring your own translation, and apply to your product UI.

:::note

Currently we only support language customization for Sign in UI. This langauge settings doesn’t apply to the admin console language setting.

#### Set your language mode

<img alt="Sign-in experience - Others" src={sieOthers} style={{ maxWidth: 560 }} />

If you want to configure your languages, go to **Sign in Experience** > **Others** > **Language**.

There are two items: **Enable auto-detect** and select a **Default language**.  
By default the auto-detect mode is on, which means your app detects the user's locale settings and auto switch to the available languages in Logto.  
The default language in this case is a fallback language if detected language is not supported in Logto.

However, Logto can make it possible by bringing your own translation.  
Click **Manage language**, select the language tag, add your own translation and save.  
You will see it is added in the left nav meantime shown in the default language dropdown.

#### Manage your languge

<img alt="Manage language" src={manageLanguage} style={{ maxWidth: 560 }} />

Clicking the manage language button will open a modal.

On the left side they are the languages Logto provided and you can see a tag Logto provided next to the language tag.  
You can't delete those pre-defined languages but can customize values of each individual key.  
Your custom values will overwrite Logto source values when it loads in front of the end users.

#### Let's take an example

Here is an example, let's say you have a website, whose default language is English and auto detect is on.
A user whose locale setting is Japan and gets a chance to visit your website and sign up an account.
Unfortunately, Logto doesn't support Japanese for now, then the user will see the sign in UI in English by default.

However, we make this possile in Admin Console.

Select Japanese language tag ja-JP, add your own translation and save. Your end customer whose locale setting is Japan will be able to see Japnese, which you just translated, on your website.

If you turn of the auto-detect, the default language is the only language your app or website will show. We do not recommend this mode in general since it will limit you target audiences.

#### FAQ

> What if the language I added becomes Logto provided language?

Then the language you addded on the left side will have a `Logto provided` tag next to the language tag and the language can't be deleted. The custom values you added still work and overwrite Logto source values. You can clear the custom values to end up using Logto source values instead.

> What if I add custom values partially?

The two columns will merge and as a whole this is what the end users will see.  
Let's take English as an example, you don't like only a few copies Logto provided and you just want to customize a few, not all of them. Find the keys and customize the values accordingly, and your sign in UI versus Logto provided UI will be only different in the keys you edited. The rest of the content stay original and the same.

## What's next

Yeah, yeah. Signing in without entering the password is the trend. Logto cannot miss it and has built-in support. Choose the one you like to continue:
